## Real-time Chat Room ðŸ’¬

A real-time chat room built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Firebase. The user can send a message in one of the chat rooms available (general, music, books, or movies) and can also update the username, which is stored in local storage. Firestore is used as a backend database to store and retrieve chat messages. 
This project was built as part of the Modern JavaScript Course by [The Net Ninja (Udemy)](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-javascript-from-novice-to-ninja/). It was deployed with Firebase Hosting.
